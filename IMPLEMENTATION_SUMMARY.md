## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Teams
- `POST /api/teams` - Create team
- `GET /api/teams/user-teams` - Get user's teams  
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId` - Get team details
- `PUT /api/teams/:teamId` - Update team

### Members
- `POST /api/teams/:teamId/members` - Invite member
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/members` - List members
- `PUT /api/teams/:teamId/members/:userId` - Update member
- `DELETE /api/teams/:teamId/members/:userId` - Remove member

### Permissions

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Backend Route Protection
```typescript
app.post('/api/campaigns', 
  authenticate, 
  requirePermission('create_campaign'), 
  CampaignController.create
);
```

### Frontend Permission Check
```tsx
<PermissionGuard permission="edit_campaign">
  <Button>Edit Campaign</Button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

### Manual Permission Check
```typescript
const { hasPermission } = useTeam();
if (hasPermission('manage_team')) {
  // Show team management UI
}
```

## 🌟 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Email Invitations**: Send actual email invites to new members
2. **Team Transfer**: Allow owners to transfer ownership
3. **Bulk Actions**: Bulk invite/remove members
4. **Audit Logs**: Track team actions and changes
5. **Team Templates**: Predefined permission templates
6. **Integration**: Connect to actual campaign/ad management
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket notifications for team changes

## 🧪 Testing

The system is now ready for testing! You can:

1. **Create teams** via the Teams page
2. **Invite members** (users need to exist in the system first)
3. **Test permissions** by switching teams and checking access
4. **Verify API endpoints** using tools like Postman
5. **Check database** to see the data structure

The server is running on port 5000 with all endpoints active and functional.
